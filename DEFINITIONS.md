# QG Terms and Key Word Definitions
Definitions of frequently-used terms within the QueerGlobal project. A developer may encounter some of these words or terms in various literature pertaining to the tools used by the application. Every term's definition comes from a summary pulled from Slack conversations, from ChatGPT, or from GitHub Copilot.


## API
Application Program Interface

## Architecture
The overall design of a software system, and the software components it is comprised of, the externally visible properties of those components, and the relationships among them.

## Bug
Any error or defect that cause the software/application or hardware to malfunction. 

## Chore
The presence of anything not included in the feature requirements and does not meet the required workflow, process or function point.

## Cloud

## Cloud Native
Building and running applications in a way that fully utilizes the benefits provided by cloud environments. It involves developing applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services, often referred to as microservices, which can be scaled independently based on demand.

## End-to End Testing
Tests user scenarios and various path conditions by verifying that the system runs and performs tasks accurately with the same set of data from beginning to end, as intended.

## Enhancement
Any alteration or modification to the existing system for better workflow and process. 

## Framework
An abstraction that provides generic functionality which can be selectively overridden or specialized for the implementer's end goal. In code, it provides specific functionality for a standard way to build and/or deploy applications much quicker and has a stronger foundation.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
A framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources.

## Infrastructure (Software Application)
The underlying foundation or basic framework of a system. 

## Major (Change)
When there are incompatible API changes that makes an application not work as expected. 

An application's major version is signified in the first number in a semantic versioning system that uses a three-part number to identify each version of a software product. Please see SemVer for more information.

## Microservices
Same as Nanoservices. A software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

Microservices architecture is an architectural style where a complex application is decomposed into smaller, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. Microservices are typically developed and deployed independently, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance.

## Middleware
A function, or set of functions, that has access to the _request_ and _response_ cycle. It can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware in the stack.

## Minor (Semantic Versioning)
When there are new functionalities or features added to the software.

An application's minor version is signified in the second number in a semantic versioning system that uses a three-part number to identify each version of a software product. Please see SemVer for more information.

## OAuth
An open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the **passwords**. This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.

## OpenID Connect 
An authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0. OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users.

## Patch (Semantic Versioning)
When there are bug fixes.

An application's patch version is signified in the third number in a semantic versioning system that uses a three-part number to identify each version of a software product. Please see SemVer for more information.

## Priority (Levels)
The degree of urgency when/where a bug has to be addressed.
1. Must Fix: This bug must be fixed immediately; the product cannot ship with this bug.
2. Should Fix: These are important problems that should be fixed as soon as possible.  It would be an embarrassment to the company if this bug shipped.
3. Fix When Have Time: The problem should be fixed within the time available.  If the bug does not delay shipping date, then fix it.
4. Low Priority: It is not important (at this time) that these bugs be addressed.  Fix these bugs after all other bugs have been fixed.
5. Trivial: Enhancements/ Good to have features incorporated- just are out of the current scope.

## Queer
A term used to describe a person who is not heterosexual.

## Refactor
The presence of anything not included in the feature requirements but DOES meet the required workflow, process or function point.

## Resource
TBD

## Scope Creep
When a project grows beyond its original goals and objectives. Any open-source project must keep its app's scope reasonable, especially for a first version that is free.

## SemVer
Semantic Versioning, aka SemVer, is a versioning system that uses a three-part number to identify each version of a software product: 
- `major#` $:$ `minor#` $:$ `patch#`
--- Major version is incremented when there are incompatible API changes. 
--- Minor version is incremented when there are new functionalities or features added to the software. 
--- Patch version is incremented when there are bug fixes.

## Severity (Levels)
The degree of impact a bug has on the system.
1. Critical: The bug causes the system to crash, or data loss.
2. Major: The bug causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent results, or the system to be unusable.
3. Minor: The bug causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent results, or the system to be unusable.

## Spike
TBD

## TBD
To Be Determined

## Template
A pre-formatted starting point for a new document.

## User Story
A description of a feature requirement from the perspective of the end-user.

## Zero Trust
A security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust **anything** inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.
