# QG Terms and Key Word Definitions
Definitions of frequently-used terms within the QueerGlobal project. Every term's definition comes from a summary pulled from Slack conversations, from ChatGPT, or from GitHub Copilot.


## API
Application Program Interface

## Architecture
The overall design of a software system, and the software components it is comprised of, the externally visible properties of those components, and the relationships among them.

## Bug
Any error or defect that cause the software/application or hardware to malfunction. 

## Chore
The presence of anything not included in the feature requirements and does not meet the required workflow, process or function point.

## Cloud

## Cloud Native
Building and running applications in a way that fully utilizes the benefits provided by cloud environments. It involves developing applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services, often referred to as microservices, which can be scaled independently based on demand.

## End-to End Testing
Tests user scenarios and various path conditions by verifying that the system runs and performs tasks accurately with the same set of data from beginning to end, as intended.

## Enhancement
Any alteration or modification to the existing system for better workflow and process.   

## Infrastructure (Software Application)
The underlying foundation or basic framework of a system. 

## Microservices
Same as Nanoservices. A software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

Microservices architecture is an architectural style where a complex application is decomposed into smaller, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. Microservices are typically developed and deployed independently, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance.

## Priority (Levels)
The degree of urgency when/where a bug has to be addressed.
1. Must Fix: This bug must be fixed immediately; the product cannot ship with this bug.
2. Should Fix: These are important problems that should be fixed as soon as possible.  It would be an embarrassment to the company if this bug shipped.
3. Fix When Have Time: The problem should be fixed within the time available.  If the bug does not delay shipping date, then fix it.
4. Low Priority: It is not important (at this time) that these bugs be addressed.  Fix these bugs after all other bugs have been fixed.
5. Trivial: Enhancements/ Good to have features incorporated- just are out of the current scope.

## Queer
A term used to describe a person who is not heterosexual.

## Refactor
The presence of anything not included in the feature requirements but DOES meet the required workflow, process or function point.

## Resource
TBD

## Severity (Levels)
The degree of impact a bug has on the system.
1. Critical: The bug causes the system to crash, or data loss.
2. Major: The bug causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent results, or the system to be unusable.
3. Minor: The bug causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent results, or the system to be unusable.

## TBD
To Be Determined

## Template
A pre-formatted starting point for a new document.

## User Story
A description of a feature requirement from the perspective of the end-user.
