# QG Terms and Key Word Definitions
Definitions of frequently-used terms within the QueerGlobal project. Every term's definition comes from a summary pulled from Slack conversations, from ChatGPT, or from GitHub Copilot.

## Bug
Any error or defect that cause the software/application or hardware to malfunction. 

## Chore
The presence of anything not included in the feature requirements and does not meet the required workflow, process or function point.

## Enhancement
Any alteration or modification to the existing system for better workflow and process.   

## Microservices
Same as Nanoservices. A software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

Microservices architecture is an architectural style where a complex application is decomposed into smaller, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. Microservices are typically developed and deployed independently, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance.
