# Programming Set of Standards

## Purpose
These are primarily guidelines on contributing ideas and code to the QueerGlobal codebase. As well, there are other helpful insights into what is expected of us as technology industry professionals.

Note: Since ppl can’t meet at the same time, please add your coding needs, NTKs, and suggestions below. Create sections as well. If there is a suggestion that you do NOT agree with, do NOT delete it! Instead add a comment to it and tag the contributor.

## Git
Keywords for A Commits's Subject Matter Message: feat | fix | chore | refactor | docs | style | test | perf | ci | build | revert

When in doubt, refer to this helpful freeCodeCamp post! [How to Level Up Your Git Commit Messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)

Ex. of command line entry for commit message: git commit -m "fix: fix foo to enable bar"

## Pull Requests
Comments need to be professional. Stems from this Discord post
Prepending every pr title with the dev’s name. Ex: “Meke/Fix Content Row”
Agreed-upon outline for new PRs tbd. Ex can be found here
Meke doesn’t merge code if she approves a pr

## The code itself
Adding code to file another is “Responsible” for. 
Single or double quotes?

## Deleting repos
- Please don’t! Why? This:
    - Loses all previous work for everyone
    - Loses prs with important details
    - Generally is a no-no

## Code comments

## Spacing

## Naming convention
Camel casing, snake casing, pascal casing?
Different for FE and BE?
Meke likes to use snake case for BE names, and camel for FE

## Branches
Prepending every branch name with the dev’s name Ex: “meke/content-row-fix”

No force pushes on branches. That removes the commit history for that branch. We can enforce that a few different ways, including Github settings.

## Communication

### Meetings
Are you a key participant for an upcoming mtg’s subject(s)? Are you attending that meeting? Great! Can’t make it? Let someone know.
