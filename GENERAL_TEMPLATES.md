# Templates

The purpose of these templates is to ensure that what we write covers all necessary information. It is up to the author to determine whether all additional sections are to be filled out, but all required sections are clearly defined.

The requirements covered in these template sections will supply our team with the knowledge that in turn gives us the know-how to create and support great work.

Each **Note** is **not a part of the template**, but is included to provide additional information.

## Image File Naming Best Practices

### Image Tips

-   Include Queer Global in the name at the beginning.
-   Don‚Äôt use special characters.
-   Don‚Äôt use spaces.
-   Use dashes instead of underscores.
-   Use all lowercase letters.
-   Keep your filenames as short as possible.
-   Include a short description of what is in the picture (i.e., full-view-of-park).
-   Keep file types consistent (preferably. webp to keep the file sizes down).
-   Here is [a simple & free online file converter](https://convertio.co/jpg-webp/) if you only have .jpg or .png.

### General image file info

-   Include Queer Global always
-   Short 2-3 words to describe picture (i.e. trevor-project-logo)
-   Category name and/or Page Name (i.e. health-medical-resource).
-   The same wording should be used for the alt text.

Ex: _full-view-of-park.jpg_

Note: (TODO) Turn into validation ticket

## Test Plans

### Front End JS/TS Test File

-   Unit tests:
    -   Copy check
    -   Form input
    -   Form submission
    -   Logged in/out
    -   Data

### Back End JS/TS Test File

-   Unit tests:
    -   Class/FC
    -   Library tool
    -   API
    -   REST CRUD
    -   External/third-party APIs

### End-to-End/Contract Testing

-   TBD
-   Go services

### Static Security Analysis

-   TBD

### Accessibility

-   TBD

Note: The test plans for the front and back end are extremely important because as of June of 2023, QG development does not have a QA Analyst or QA Engineer on board.

Note: Any work should be tested in the latest stable versions of Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Opera (used a lot in many African countries), and Microsoft Edge.

Note: If the testing is for a bug fix or verification, the work should be tested on both a Windows and Mac machine.

Note: QA testing will possibly be done as a group. If so all work can be documented for each person [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1xlDfIMQn_NXb4PbE8QkncdGxw6H-h9RGGHn8_45z5r4/edit).
