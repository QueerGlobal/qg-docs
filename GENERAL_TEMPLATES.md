# Templates
The purpose of these templates is to ensure that what we write covers all necessary information. It is up to the author to determine whether all additional sections are to be filled out, but all required sections are clearly defined. 

The requirements covered in these template sections will supply our team with the knowledge that in turn gives us the know-how to create and support great work.

## Image File Naming Best Practices

### Image Tips:
--- Include Queer Global in the name at the beginning.
--- Don‚Äôt use special characters.
--- Don‚Äôt use spaces.
--- Use dashes instead of underscores.
--- Use all lowercase letters.
--- Keep your filenames as short as possible.
--- Include a short description of what is in the picture (i.e., full-view-of-park).
--- Keep file types consistent (preferably. webp to keep the file sizes down).
--- Here is [a simple & free online file converter](https://convertio.co/jpg-webp/) if you only have .jpg or .png.


### General image file info:
--- Include Queer Global always
--- Short 2-3 words to describe picture (i.e. trevor-project-logo)
--- Category name and/or Page Name (i.e. health-medical-resource). --- The same wording should be used for the alt text.

Ex: *full-view-of-park.jpg*

Note: (TODO) Turn into validation ticket

## Test Plans
Note: The test plans for the front and back end are extremely important because as of June of 2023, QG development does not have a QA Analyst or QA Engineer on board.

### Front End JS/TS Test File
Unit tests
Copy check
Form input
Form submission
Logged in/out
Data

### Back End JS/TS Test File
Unit tests
Class/FC
Library tool
API
REST CRUD
External/third-party


End-to-End/Contract Testing
TBD
Go services


Static Security Analysis

Accessibility

Note: The test plans for the front and back end are extremely important because as of June of 2023, QG development does not have a QA Analyst or QA Engineer on board.

Any work should be tested in the latest stable versions of Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Opera (used a lot in many African countries), and Microsoft Edge.

If the testing is for a bug fix or verification, the work should be tested on both a Windows and Mac machine.

QA testing will be done as a group and documented for each person, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1xlDfIMQn_NXb4PbE8QkncdGxw6H-h9RGGHn8_45z5r4/edit).
