## Image File Naming Best Practices

### Image Tips:
--- Include Queer Global in the name at the beginning.
--- Don’t use special characters.
--- Don’t use spaces.
--- Use dashes instead of underscores.
--- Use all lowercase letters.
--- Keep your filenames as short as possible.
--- Include a short description of what is in the picture (i.e., full-view-of-park).
--- Keep file types consistent (preferably. webp to keep the file sizes down).
--- Here is a simple & free online file converter if you only have .jpg or .png:  https://convertio.co/jpg-webp/.


### General image file info:
--- Include Queer Global always
--- Short 2-3 words to describe picture (i.e. trevor-project-logo)
--- Category name and/or Page Name (i.e. health-medical-resource). --- The same wording should be used for the alt text.

Ex: *full-view-of-park.jpg*
